# Glossary

```{glossary}

skewness 
  How often do you get an outlier in the pixel activity across time, good for calcium indicators because theyre flat relative to a few events over the course of a recording. 

mean_img
  The average of the registered movie over time. Used as a baseline representation of the structural signal.

max_proj
  The maximum value per pixel over time. Highlights regions with high fluorescence, useful for detecting active areas.

meanImgE
  Enhanced mean image generated by Suite2p using filtering and sharpening operations. Useful for anatomical segmentation when available.

anatomical segmentation
  ROI detection based solely on static images (e.g. mean or max projection), ignoring fluorescence time dynamics.

functional segmentation
  ROI detection based on pixelwise correlations across time, identifying spatially contiguous regions with similar activity patterns.

seed
  A pixel or region in the image used as the **starting point** for growing a potential ROI.
  Seeding is based on high-intensity regions in the filtered image, and forms the initial guess
  for the shape and location of a neuron.

Delta F over F0
    $\Delta F / F_0$ (Delta F over F naught) refers to the fractional change in fluorescence relative to a baseline signal F₀.
    This is a common normalization used in calcium imaging and neural activity recordings.

segmentation
  The general process of dividing an image based on the contents of that image, in our case, based on neuron location.

source-extraction
  Umbrella term for all of the individual processes that produce a segmented image.

deconvolution
  The process performed after segmentation to the resulting traces to infer spike times from flourescence values.

Rigid-registration
  The object retains shape and size.

Non-rigid-registration
  The object is moved and transforms shape or size.

pixel-resolution
  The length of each pixel, in micron (px/um).

LBM
  Light Beads Microscopy. A volumetric imaging technique where z-planes are acquired as ScanImage channels using multiple beamlets.

piezo
  Piezo z-stack acquisition. Uses a piezo actuator to step through z-positions, acquiring frames at each depth before moving.

LBMPiezo
  Combined LBM and piezo acquisition. Has both LBM characteristics (>2 channels as beamlets) and piezo stepping. Used for pollen calibration workflows.

OutputMetadata
  A class that computes adjusted metadata when writing subsets of data. Automatically scales z-step when selecting every Nth plane, and invalidates frame rate for non-contiguous frame selections.

OME-NGFF
  Open Microscopy Environment Next Generation File Format. A specification for storing multidimensional imaging data in Zarr format with standardized metadata for coordinate transforms and axis definitions.

volumetric output
  Writing 4D data (T, Z, Y, X) to a single file with plane/frame selection support. Both TIFF (ImageJ hyperstack) and Zarr (OME-NGFF v0.5) formats are supported.

reactive metadata
  Metadata that automatically adjusts based on data selection. For example, `dz` doubles when selecting every 2nd z-plane, and `fs` becomes invalid for non-contiguous frame selections.
